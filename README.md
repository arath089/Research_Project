FEATURE EXTRACTION FOR CHEYNES-STOKES BREATHING PATTERN FOR HEART FAILURE DETECTION

Cheynes-Stokes Respiration is found in people of all ages, from children and young adults to the elderly. However, the most affected group lies in the age group of under 60 years of age. Almost 1.4 million of the 5 million Americans fall under that group.

Cheynes-Stokes Respiration pattern is characterized by recurrent occurrence of apneas and hypopneas which makes a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of the tidal
volume. It is a form of disordered breathing that can lead to Chronic Heart Failure.

<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>
We have used the X4M03 XeThru UWB Radar SoC in our project setup. The Radar system setup are positioned on a horizontal stand. The received signals are
recorded for further processing. For this experiment, the subjects are positioned at a distance of 1 to 3 meters from the panel antenna where the antenna is focused
on the chest area of the patient. The subjects are either sitting on a chair or lying down on the bed. The received signals are stored in an excel file which is sent for
further processing using MATLAB and Python.
